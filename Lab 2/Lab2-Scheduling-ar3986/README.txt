Lab #2: Scheduling Lab (Java)

To compile: javac *.java
To run: java [one of the scheduling algorithm classes] [text document input name with ".txt" extention] [random-numbers.txt]

--> the scheduling algorithm classes are named "FCFS.java", "SJF.java", "RoundRobin.java", "Uniprogrammed.java"

Add the prefix "-v" before the input text file to get verbose output

The way I went about solving the lab was to separate each of the scheduling algorithms and then have separate classes that will handle the scheduling and definition of a process. I got the idea to approach the problem from others and from reading over the lab instructions online.
