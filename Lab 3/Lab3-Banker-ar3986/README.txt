Lab #3: Bankers Algorithm Lab (Java)

To compile: javac *.java
To run: java BankerLab [text document input name with ".txt" extention]

There is only one class file and everything is handled within it. It is not the most elegant way, but the it is set up by reading the input file, doing the FIFO algorithm, resetting the variables, and then running Banker's algorithm. The program will print the necessary output.
